# GPLATES_VERSION_PRERELEASE - Pre-release version (empty for official public release).
#
# This should be:
# - empty for official public releases,
# - a number for development releases (eg, 1, 2, etc),
# - 'alpha' followed by '.' followed by a number for alpha releases (eg, alpha.1, alpha.2, etc),
# - 'beta' followed by '.' followed by a number for beta releases (eg, beta.1, beta.2, etc),
# - 'rc' followed by '.' followed by a number for release candidates (eg, rc.1, rc.2, etc).
#
# The reason for the above rules is they support the correct version ordering precedence for both Semantic Versioning and Debian versioning
# (even though Semantic and Debian versioning have slightly different precedence rules).
#
# Semantic version precedence separates identifiers between dots and compares each identifier.
# According to https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html ...
# - digit-only identifiers are compared numerically,
# - identifiers with letters are compared lexically in ASCII order,
# - numeric identifiers have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers.
# ...and so '1' < 'beta.1' because '1' < 'beta', and 'beta.1' < 'beta.2' because 'beta' == 'beta' but '1' < '2'.
#
# Debian version precedence separates identifiers into alternating non-digit and digit identifiers.
# According to https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version ...
# - find initial part consisting only of non-digits and compare lexically in ASCII order (modified so letters sort earlier than non-letters, and '~' earliest of all),
# - find next part consisting only of digits and compare numerically,
# - repeat the above two steps until a difference is found.
# ...and so '1' < 'beta.1' because '' < 'beta.', and 'beta.1' < 'beta.2' because 'beta.' == 'beta.' but '1' < '2'.
#
# For example:
# For Semantic Versioning: 2.3.0-1 < 2.3.0-alpha.1 < 2.3.0-beta.1 < 2.3.0-rc.1 < 2.3.0.
# For Debian versioning:   2.3.0~1 < 2.3.0~alpha.1 < 2.3.0~beta.1 < 2.3.0~rc.1 < 2.3.0.
