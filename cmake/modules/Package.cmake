endif()

# Specify which components to package by default.
#
# There are two components available for packaging:
# - gplates
# - pygplates
#
# By default, we only package 'gplates'.
#
# This is because 'pygplates' will soon be installable via 'conda' (and maybe ultimately via 'pip', although pygplates
# has many shared library dependencies and 'pip' is not really designed to handle that).
# So typically only the 'install' process would be used for 'pygplates' (eg, 'cmake --install . --component pygplates --prefix staging),
# but not the 'packaging' process (ie, turning a staged installation into a package). Instead the staged installation
# (without subsequent packaging with cpack) could be used as part of the conda build process (currently investigating this).
#
# However, if you want to package both 'gplates' and 'pygplates' then run 'cpack -G ZIP -D CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL=gplates;pygplates'.
# Note the use of '-G ZIP', for example on Windows, to override the CPACK_GENERATOR default above (NSIS;ZIP) since you would not
# want to create an NSIS package for pygplates. In fact it's currently not possible to create an NSIS package for pygplates anyway because
# we have CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL turned ON (for all generators, except archive generators like ZIP) and we use EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL in the
# 'install()' commands for the 'pygplates' component, and together these two settings appear to result in NSIS packaging up all components
# from a *default* installation (which includes only component 'gplates').
# In any case, typically you would package 'gplates' and 'pygplates' in *separate* 'cpack' runs.
# In this case you'd want to package 'gplates' with just 'cpack' (to create both an NSIS installer and a ZIP archive by default) and
# package 'pygplates' with 'cpack -G ZIP -D CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL=pygplates' (but note that when extracting the resultant archive you
# would have a top-level directory that looked something like 'gplates_2.3.0_win64/', so you'd probably want to manually rename that).
# Note the space in '-D CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL' (without the space it won't override the default).
#
# NOTE: We only specify CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL when CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL is disabled because they are conflicting
#       (CPack will issue a warning and default to monolithic). We have CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL enabled by default and
#       only disable it for the archive generators. As a result we don't set CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL here, instead overriding it
#       in PackageGeneratorOverrides.cmake for archive generators only.
#set(CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL gplates)

#   CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL - Disables the component-based installation mechanism.
#
#   When set, the component specification is ignored and all installed items are put in a single "MONOLITHIC" package.
#   Some CPack generators do monolithic packaging by default and may be asked to do component packaging by setting
#   CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL to TRUE.
#
# We only want component-based installs (for components gplates and pygplates) for archive generators.
# NSIS, DragNDrop and Debian should be monolithic which, as mentioned near the top of this file, will only package the 'gplates' component
# (since we used EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL in the 'install()' commands for the 'pygplates' component).
