# There are two targets we can install:
# - gplates
# - pygplates
#
# By default we only install 'gplates'. This is done by...
#
# Always specifying COMPONENT in each 'install()' command. And that component is either 'gplates' or 'pygplates'.
# When we specify 'pygplates' we also specify EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL which means the 'pygplates' component is only used for
# component-based installs. An example of a component-based install is running 'cmake --install . --component pygplates'
# after having built pygplates (eg, with 'cmake .' and then 'cmake --build . --target pygplates'). For a non-component install
# (eg, 'cmake --install .') 'pygplates' would be excluded and only 'gplates' installed (due to the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL flag).
#
# However in most cases you wouldn't typically install directly like this.
# More likely you'd create a package using CPack. For CPack generators we've configured as monolithic (eg, NSIS, DragNDrop and Debian)
# the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL flag will exclude the pygplates component. For CPack generators we've configured as component-based
# (eg, archive generators like ZIP) CPack will instead use the CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL variables to select components to package (see Package.cmake).

# Whether to install GPlates as a standalone bundle (by copying dependency libraries during installation).
#
# On Windows and Apple we have install code to fix up GPlates for deployment to another machine
# (which mainly involves copying dependency libraries into the install location, which subsequently gets packaged).
# This is always enabled, so we don't provide an option to the user to disable it.
#
# On Linux systems we don't enable by default (see ConfigDefault.cmake) the copying of dependency libraries because there we rely
# on the Linux binary package manager to install them (for example, we create a '.deb' package that only *lists* the dependencies,
# which are then installed on the target system if not already there).
# However we allow the user to enable this in case they want to create a standalone bundle for their own use case.
#
if (GPLATES_INSTALL_STANDALONE)
    #
    # Configure install code to fix up GPlates for deployment to another machine.
    #
    # Note that we don't get Qt to deploy its libraries/plugins to our install location (using windeployqt/macdeployqt).
    # Instead we find the Qt library dependencies ourself and we explicitly list the Qt plugins we expect to use.
    # On Windows: The official pre-built Qt binaries are configured for 'dynamic' OpenGL (see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-requirements.html).
    #             This means the normal desktop OpenGL drivers will be used where sufficient, otherwise Qt falls back to ANGLE or software OpenGL.
    #             This fallback relies on the ANGLE or software DLLs being present. They are dynamically loaded, rather than being dynamically linked, and
    #             so are not found by file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES) and so are not deployed. However 'windeployqt' will include those ANGLE and software DLLs.
    #             But the fact that we're not using 'windeployqt' is fine because GPlates uses OpenGL 3.3 which is above what ANGLE and software supports
    #             and so Qt cannot fallback. Hence not deploying the ANGLE and software DLLs is not a problem. GPlates also tells Qt not to fall back by
    #             specifying the Qt::AA_UseDesktopOpenGL attribute (in the C++ code).
    # On macOS:   The Qt deployment tool 'macdeployqt' actually deploys more than just the Qt libraries/plugins (and the libraries they depend on).
    #             It also deploys all libraries that GPlates depends on (eg, Boost, GDAL, etc). But we're already doing this via file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)
    #             and we're explicitly listing the Qt plugins. So we don't really need to use 'macdeployqt'.

    # Run the deployment code in the install prefix location.

    # This consists of a bunch of "install(CODE ...)" commands to install code into "cmake_install.cmake" that CMake in turn
    # executes at 'install' time into the install prefix location ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} (evaluated at 'install' time).
    #
    # Note: The command "install(CODE)" requires CMake 3.14 since we're using generator expressions in the code.
    #
    # Note: When using CODE with double quotes, as with install(CODE "<code>"), variable subsitution is *enabled*.
    #       So we use this when transferring variables.
    #       However when using square brackets, as with install(CODE [[<code>]]), variable subitition is *disabled* (as is escaping).
    #       So we use this for the bulk of code to avoid unwanted variable transfer (instead using variables defined at *install* time)
    #       and to avoid having to escape characters (like double quotes).
    #       An example of this is ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} where we use square brackets (CODE [[<code>]]) to ensure it is expanded only at
    #       install time (not at configure time). This is important because it can be different. For example, at configure time it might
    #       default to "c:/Program Files/${PROJECT_NAME}", but when packaging, the install prefix will instead be the staging area.

        #       installed GPlates application bundle (or base install directory of pygplates) depending of whether a regular '.dylib' or a framework.
        #   2 - Fix up the path to each *direct* dependency of GPlates/pyGPlates, its Qt plugins and their resolved dependencies
        #       (ie, each dependency will depend on other dependencies in turn and must point to their location within the installation).
        #   3 - Code sign GPlates/pyGPlates, its Qt plugins and their resolved dependencies with a valid Developer ID certificate.
        #       For GPlates we also then code sign the entire application *bundle* (for pyGPlates, the 'pygplates.so' library has already been signed).
        #   4 - Notarize the application bundle. Although this is not done here (during the installation phase) because we package it into a DMG during
        #       the CPack packaging phase (see Package.cmake) and the DMG is what should be uploaded for notarization (after codesigning the DMG).
        #       So the entire notarization process is currently done outside of CMake/CPack and should follow the procedure outlined here:
        #           https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow
        #       For GPlates this amounts to code signing the DMG file created by CPack, uploading to Apple for notarization, checking for successful
        #       notarization and then stapling the notarization ticket to the DMG file. Once that is all done the DMG can be distributed to users.
        #       For pyGPlates we currently get CPack to produce a ZIP archive (notarization does not support TBZ2 for example) containing the code signed
        #       dependency libraries (and pygplates), then upload the archive to Apple for notarization and check for successful notarization.
        #       However you cannot staple a notarization ticket to a ZIP archive (you must instead staple each item in the archive and then create a new archive).
        #       If an item is not stapled then Gatekeeper finds the ticket online (stapling is so the ticket can be found when the network is offline).
        #       So currently we don't staple the items. Another potential issue is using 'zip' versus 'ditto', apparently the latter can stored extended attributes
        #       but the former is used by CPack. This could be an issue if something is code signed that is not a Mach-O file (exe, library, etc) and hence the
        #       signature has to be stored in an extended attribute. But currently we are not running into this issue.
        #       Note that soon we will use Conda to build pyGPlates packages and no longer rely on CPack. Or rely on Apple notarization for that matter because the
        #       Conda package manager will then be responsible for installing pygplates on the user's computer, and so conda will then be responsible for quarantine.
