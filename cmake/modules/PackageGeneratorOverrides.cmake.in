#   This file is included at cpack time, once per generator after CPack has set CPACK_GENERATOR                                     #
#   to the actual generator being used. It allows per-generator setting of CPACK_* variables at cpack time.                         #
#                                                                                                                                   #
# This is our own configuration file to handle generator-specific settings for CPACK variables that are used by multiple generators #
# (eg, NSIS, DragNDrop). For example, CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON uses different icon formats for different generators.                      #
# This is not needed for CPACK_<GENERATOR>_ variables (since they only apply to a specific generator).                              #
