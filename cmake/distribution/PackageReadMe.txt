GPlates is a plate-tectonics program. Manipulate reconstructions of geological and paleo-geographic features through geological time. Interactively visualize vector, raster and volume data. PyGPlates is the GPlates Python library. Get fine-grained access to GPlates functionality in your Python scripts.

GPlates can:
- handle and visualise data in a variety of geometries and formats, including raster data
- link plate kinematics to geodynamic models
- serve as an interactive client in a grid-computing network
- facilitate the production of high-quality paleo-geographic maps

Features of GPlates
-------------------

Feature Data IO - Load/save geological, geographic and tectonic feature data.

Data Visualization - Visualize vector/raster data on a globe or in one of the map projections.

Reconstruction Tools - Modify reconstructions graphically.

Cookie-cutting - Assign reconstruction/rotation poles to feature data by cookie-cutting with plate polygons.

3D Scalar Data - Visualize sub-surface 3D scalar fields.

Surface Velocities - Calculate surface velocities in topological plate polygons and deforming meshes.

Reconstruct Data - Reconstruct/rotate feature data (vector and raster data).

Export Data - Export reconstructed data as a time-sequence of exported files.

Edit Feature - Query and edit feature properties and geometries.

Deforming - Track crustal extension/contraction inside deforming regions.

PyGPlates - Use PyGPlates to access GPlates functionality in your Python scripts.
