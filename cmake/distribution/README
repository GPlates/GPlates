Creating Qt icons
-----------------
The executable application icon that is displayed on the desktop (prior to application execution) needs to be created differently for each platform.

Windows ("gplates_desktop_icon.ico"):
 * The icon file "gplates_desktop_icon.ico" was generated by using â€‹the convertico website (http://www.convertico.com) to convert from "src/qt-resources/GPlates-icon-160x160-opaque.png".
   - On that website, under "Choose Icon Layer Sizes" select 128x128, 64x64, 48x48, 32x32 and 16x16.
   - Drag'n'drop "GPlates-icon-160x160-opaque.png" onto the website and then click on the download link to get "GPlates-icon-160x160-opaque.ico".
   - Then rename "GPlates-icon-160x160-opaque.ico" to "gplates_desktop_icon.ico" and move it to "cmake/distribution/".
   - Note that you may need to restart Windows before the new icon shows up properly
     (otherwise it still displays as the old icon, even though it's clearly the new one if you open it in an image editor).
 * The "gplates_desktop_icon.rc" (which references the above '.ico' file and is added to CMake as a source file) takes care of embedding the icon into  the GPlates executable.

Mac OSX ("gplates_desktop_icon.icns"):
 * Open up "/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Icon Composer".
 * Select 'File->Import Image".
 * Select the icon to convert (currently we use "src/qt-resources/GPlates-icon-160x160-opaque.png").
 * Under "Import To:" select "Thumbnail 32bit data" (this is the largest size at 128x128).
 * You'll get a message "Alert: Image does not have a representation with the same dimensions" -  select "Use scaled version".
 * Check "Go into application bundles".
 * Select 'File->Import Image" again and select same input image file.
 * Under "Import To:" select "Huge 32bit data".
 * You'll get a message "Alert: Image does not have a representation with the same dimensions" -  select "Use scaled version".
 * You'll get a message "Alert: Extract Huge 1bit mask from data also?" -  select "Extract Mask".
 * Select 'File->Import Image" again and select same input image file.
 * Under "Import To:" select "Large 32bit data".
 * You'll get a message "Alert: Image does not have a representation with the same dimensions" -  select "Use scaled version".
 * You'll get a message "Alert: Extract Huge 1bit mask from data also?" -  select "Extract Mask".
 * Select 'File->Import Image" again and select same input image file.
 * Under "Import To:" select "Small 32bit data".
 * You'll get a message "Alert: Image does not have a representation with the same dimensions" -  select "Use scaled version".
 * You'll get a message "Alert: Extract Huge 1bit mask from data also?" -  select "Extract Mask".
 * Select "File-Save" and select the filename to save to (eg "gplates_desktop_icon") - the file extension ".icns" will be added for you.
