GPlates offers a novel combination of interactive plate tectonic reconstructions, geographic information system (GIS) functionality and raster data visualisation. GPlates enables both the visualisation and the manipulation of plate tectonic reconstructions and associated data through geological time. GPlates runs on macOS, Windows and Linux. GPlates is developed at the University of Sydney, the California Institute of Technology and the Norwegian Geological Survey.
