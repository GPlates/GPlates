documented in the "Program and library dependencies" section in the "DEPS.OSX"
file in this directory.

After installing those dependencies, to compile on Mac OS X, execute:

Compiling GPlates on Windows
----------------------------

To compile GPlates on Microsoft Windows, you will need the programs and libraries
as documented in the "Program and library dependencies" section in the "DEPS.Windows"
file in this directory.

To compile on Windows:
 * Edit the 'CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH' environment variable to refer to the include paths for
   Boost, GDAL and ICU packages you've installed.
 * The Gzip package should be found automatically if it's installed in 'C:/Program Files/GnuWin32/'.
 * Run the CMake program ('CMakeSetup.exe'). CMake 2.6.2 and above is fine.
      Vista NOTE: You need to elevate permissions on 'CMakeSetup.exe' by
      right-click->properties->compatibility(tab)->check "run this program as an administrator".
 * Set both the 'source' and 'build' directories to the root GPlates source directory
   (the one that has 'src' as a sub-directory).
 * Click 'configure'.
 * Specify 'Visual Studio 2005'.
 * Click 'configure' once more.
 * Click 'OK'.
 * Open newly created 'GPlates.sln' with the Visual Studio IDE.
 * Select 'Release' build from the "Build->Configuration Manager..." menu.
 * Rebuild All from the Build menu.

More information can be found in the files "DEPS.Windows" and "BUILD.Windows" in this directory.
