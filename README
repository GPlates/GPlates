Compiling GPlates on Linux
--------------------------

To compile GPlates on Linux, you will need the following programs and libraries
installed:
 * CMake (2.4 or newer)
 * g++ 4
 * make
 * GL library (the OpenGL shared library)
 * GLU library (the OpenGL Utility shared library)
 * Expat library
 * Qt library (version 4.3.2 or newer)
 * ICU library
 * Boost library headers
 * Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) (1.3.2 or newer)
 * Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CDAL) (3.3.1 or newer)

To compile on Linux, execute:
	cmake .
	make
and then optionally:
	make install

More information can be found in the files "DEPS.Linux" and "BUILD.Linux" in
this directory.


Compiling GPlates on Mac OSX
----------------------------

To compile GPlates on Mac OSX, you will need the following programs and libraries

 * g++ 4
 * make
 * GL library (the OpenGL shared library)
 * GLU library (the OpenGL Utility shared library)
 * Qt library (version 4.3.2 or newer)
 * ICU library
 * Boost library headers
 * Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) (1.3.2 or newer)
 * Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CDAL) (3.3.1 or newer)

this directory.


Compiling GPlates on Windows
----------------------------

To compile GPlates on Microsoft Windows, you will need the following programs
and libraries installed:
 * CMake (2.4 or newer)
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 8
 * Qt (version 4.3.4 or newer)
 * ICU
 * Boost
 * Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) (1.3.2 or newer)
 * Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CDAL) (3.3.1 or newer)

To compile on Windows:
 * Edit the 'CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH' environment variable to refer to the include paths for
   Boost, GDAL and ICU packages you've installed.
 * The Gzip package should be found automatically if it's installed in 'C:/Program Files/GnuWin32/'.
 * Run the CMake program ('CMakeSetup.exe'). CMake 2.4.8 and above is fine.
      Vista NOTE: You need to elevate permissions on 'CMakeSetup.exe' by
      right-click->properties->compatibility(tab)->check "run this program as an administrator".
 * Set both the 'source' and 'build' directories to the root GPlates source directory
   (the one that has 'src' as a sub-directory).
 * Click 'configure'.
 * Specify 'Visual Studio 2005'.
 * Click 'configure' once more.
 * Click 'OK'.
 * Open newly created 'GPlates.sln' with the Visual Studio IDE.
 * Select 'release' build from the "Build->Configuration Manager..." menu.
 * Rebuild All from the Build menu.

More information can be found in the file "BUILD.Windows" in this directory.
