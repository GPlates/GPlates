GPlates provides interactive plate tectonic reconstructions. It
is designed to enable students of earth sciences to manipulate
plates on the surface of the globe and create reconstructions
of likely plate positions in the past. It will also provide
researchers in the earth sciences field with a powerful tool
to combine various types of data, such as point, line and
gridded data, and simulate the changes in this data over time.

This version of GPlates is 0.5 beta.  It is the first public
release of GPlates, and as such will likely contain bugs.

We would be most grateful if you could provide any feedback
on what you think is good or bad about GPlates, and especially
to provide information about bugs that you find.  Contact
details may be found at the end of this file.

Current functionality includes:
 - display of point and line data;
 - mouse-oriented globe spinning and zooming;
 - colour-coding of data with plate id;
 - reconstruction of data at a particular time in the past in
  accordance with a rotation hierarchy;
 - animation of data through a time interval in accordance with
  a rotation hierarchy.
 - import of PLATES data and rotation files; and
 - import and export of our files in our own GPML format.

You should check out our website for additional information, 
including various documentation and sample data files.
