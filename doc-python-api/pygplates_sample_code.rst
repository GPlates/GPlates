Sample code
===========

This document contains sample code that shows *pygplates* solving common plate tectonic problems.

.. note:: The :ref:`pygplates_getting_started` section has a
   :ref:`Getting Started tutorial<pygplates_getting_started_tutorial>` as well as an
   :ref:`installation guide<pygplates_getting_started_installation>` to help get started.
