# using 'autosummary' with ':toctree:' to generate a stub ".rst" file for each class/function.
# The templates just change the appearance of each class/function from the default provided
# by autosummary. But it seems we can get decent looking documentation without using templates
# by specifying the 'autodoc_default_flags' flag below to include 'members' and 'inherited-members'
