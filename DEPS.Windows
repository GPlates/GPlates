Introduction

This page lists the program and library dependencies which need to be satisfied
to be able to build GPlates from source on Windows.

Environment variables

Instructions below may direct you to modify the PATH variable, to add
directories to the search path for executable files. (Note that the name of the
variable is not case sensitive, so it could be called Path instead.)

 * Windows XP:
     1. Click on the Start button.
     2. Right-click on My Computer and select Properties.
     3. On the Advanced tab, click on the Environment Variables button.
     4. If you edit the PATH variable in the User variables section, the change
        only affects your account. If you edit the PATH variable in the System
        variables section (assuming you have sufficient privileges to do so),
        the change will affect all users on the computer. Edit the variable in
        whichever section is most suitable. If the PATH variable does not exist,
        click the New button to add it. Separate paths with semicolons.
 * Windows Vista (if you have administrator access and you wish to change the
   PATH variable for all users):
     1. Click on the Start button.
     2. Right-click on Computer and select Properties.
     3. Click on the Advanced system settings link in the left-hand Tasks panel.
     4. If prompted, enter an administrator password for UAC.
     5. On the Advanced tab, click on the Environment Variables button.
     6. Edit the PATH variable in the System variables section. If the PATH
        variable does not exist, click the New button to add it. Separate paths
        with semicolons.
 * Windows Vista (if you do not have administrator access or you wish to change
   the PATH variable only for your account):
     1. Click on the Start button.
     2. Click your account's picture at the very top of the second column.
     3. Click on the Change my environment variables link in the left-hand Tasks
        panel.
     4. Edit the PATH variable in the User variables section. If the PATH
        variable does not exist, click the New button to add it. Separate paths
        with semicolons.

Library dependencies

The following libraries and binaries are required to build GPlates. If you
cannot use, or you cannot obtain, the exact same version as listed, you should
try to use a version with the same major and minor build numbers (i.e. for a
version number of x.y.z, you should aim to keep x and y the same).

CMake

  1. Get and install cmake-2.6.2-win32-x86.exe from: http://www.cmake.org/

Qt

  1. Download qt-win-opensource-src-4.3.4.zip from: http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/
  2. Extract it to a path containing no spaces 
  3. Run: configure 
  4. Run: nmake 
  5. In VC access Tools, Options, Projects, Directories and add the following Qt 
    directories: 
      * Executable files: \bin
  6. Add the Qt \bin and \qmake directories to the PATH environment variable
     (see above).

Boost

  1. Get and install boost_1_34_1_setup.exe from:
     http://www.boostpro.com/download
      * In addition to the default packages, also install "Program Options".

ICU

  1. Get and extract icu4c-3_8-Win32-msvc8.zip from: http://icu-project.org/
     download/3.8.html 
  2. In VC access Tools, Options, Projects, Directories and add the following 
     ICU directories: 
       * Executable files: \bin
  3. Add the \bin directory to the PATH environment variable (see above).

Expat

  1. Get and install Expat 2.0.1 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files/expat_win32/
  2. Add the Expat \Bin directory to the PATH environment variable (see above).

FWTools (for GDAL and Proj4)

  1. Get and install FWTools 2.4.5 from http://home.gdal.org/fwtools/ 
  2. Add the FWTools \bin folder to the PATH environment variable (see above).
  3. If you downloaded a version of FWTools prior to 2.4.5, make a copy of
     proj.dll in the \bin folder and call it proj_fw.dll.

gzip

  1. Get and install gzip from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gzip.htm 
     . Select the 'complete package, except sources' link.
       * Alternatively, Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/), a complete POSIX
         environment for Windows, contains gzip.
  2. Add the location of the gzip executable to the PATH environment variable
     (see above).

Graphviz (required for documentation, but not required to build GPlates)

  1. Get and install the latest version of Graphviz from http://www.graphviz.org/
  2. Add the location of the Graphviz main executable to the PATH environment
     variable (see above).

Doxygen (required for documentation, but not required to build GPlates)

  1. Get and install the latest version of Doxygen from
     http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc
  2. Add the location of the Doxygen main executable to the PATH environment
     variable (see above).
