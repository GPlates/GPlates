	 * Stream writer class to write to a fixed size buffer.

	 * This is one way to write to a vertex buffer (using gl.MapBuffer/gl.MapBufferRange).
	 *
	 * This is useful when you don't know how many vertices/indices you're going to stream and
	 * you're not going to re-use the vertices/indices.
	 * In this case you just want to fill up a fixed size vertex buffer and, when its full, send
	 * it off to the GPU and then continue filling the vertex buffer up again, etc.
	 * In this scenario it doesn't make sense to determine the number of vertices beforehand and
	 * allocate a vertex buffer of the appropriate size (ie, that's not a very optimal way to draw).
	 *
	 * Since we could be writing to a vertex buffer object we might only have write access
	 * to the memory - so this class acts like a raw pointer but only allows writes and not reads.
