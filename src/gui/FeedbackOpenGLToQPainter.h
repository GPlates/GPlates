	 * Used to feedback OpenGL rendering into a QPainter.
	 *
	 * For vector geometry such as points, polylines and polygons the mechanism of OpenGL feedback
	 * is used in order to render to a QPainter's paint device.
	 * Currently we're using base OpenGL feedback which only works with the fixed-function pipeline
	 * and so it doesn't currently work with vertex shaders.
	 *
	 * TODO: Implement OpenGL 2/3 feedback extensions to enable feedback from vertex shaders.
	 *
	 * For rasters the results of rendering are returned in a QImage which is then sent to the QPainter.
	 * This QImage based rendering can also be used for vector geometry if desired (for example, if
	 * rendering to SVG and would like to keep non-geological vector geometries separate from
	 * geological vector geometries then can render the former to a QImage and it'll end up as an
	 * embeded image in the SVG file).
