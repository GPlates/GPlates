/**
 * Scribe export registered classes/types for *external* libraries.
 *
 * Also includes are the fundamental types (integral/floating-point).
 *
 * The list of libraries include:
 *   (1) C++ standard library,
 *   (2) Qt.
 *
 *
 * Note: Apparently 'char', 'signed char' and 'unsigned char' are three distinct types (unlike integer types).
 *
 * Note: The types 'short', 'int' and 'long' also pick up 'signed short', 'signed int' and 'signed long'.
 *
 * Also including scribe utility classes in this 'scribe' source sub-directory.
