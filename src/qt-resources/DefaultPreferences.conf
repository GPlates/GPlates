; Now that's out of the way, a few notes on editing this file:
; - It is stored as Qt's QSettings::IniFormat. Details can be found
;   at http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qsettings.html#Format-enum .
;
; - Use app-logic/UserPreferences.h to access GPlates keys, which will
;   automatically fall back to the defaults set out here. If you are
;   adding a new key, it might be desirable to include a default value
;   for that key here, and possibly a description of the key's purpose.
;
; - Even if you can't think of a sensible default value, it might be
;   a good idea to include a definition for your key here just so that
;   we developers know what keys exist and are being used in the code.
;
; - Key names are hierarchical as you'd expect from the UserPreferences
;   interface, but instead of using '/' as a path delimiter, this file
;   uses '\'. Ugly, I know, but Qt is doing its best to stick to the
;   'standard' .ini format and we should be thankful we don't have to
;   implement it ourselves.
;
; - Top-level keys that group subkeys together are specified as [keyname].
;   Don't try to name a top-level group "General".
;
; - Treat keys as though they were case-sensitive, because they might be.
;
; - Prefer a lowercased naming scheme with underscores to separate words.
;
; - Everything after the '=' is data, strings don't use quotes. You can
;   embed newlines in the data portion as usual with \n.
;
; - Data starting with an @ is interpreted specially by Qt for embedding
;   custom classes. So avoid it.
;
; - Finally, if you're unsure how Qt represents some complex value and
;   need to work out how to define a default for it here in this file,
;   you may be able to set the value via GPlates on a Linux system, and
;   then check your ~/.config/GPlates/GPlates.conf to see the Ini-style
;   representation.


[version]
; The key "current" has no default and is set by GPlates. It holds the most recent version of GPlates that is in use on this machine.


[session]
auto_save_on_quit=1

; Recent session data are stored under the 'recent/' subkey, interpreted in an array-like fashion the way Qt does.
; The one key we actually have a default for in there is the maximum number of sessions to keep.
recent\max_size=8

; whether or not to show stars when GPlates starts.
show_stars=false

[view\animation]

; The time range for animations that GPlates uses at start-up.
