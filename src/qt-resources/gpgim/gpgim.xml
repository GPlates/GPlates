		            GPGIM structure (or schema)
		==================================================
		
		The following paragraphs describe the structure, or schema, of this document.
		In other words, what XML elements you can add to this document and where and how often.

		A supplementary gpgim.xsd file provides an XML Schema to validate this gpgim.xml file against,
		however it is not a comprehensive definition and should only be used to check for basic errors.

		A stylesheet file, gpgim.xsl, is also supplied. Presuming you have that file in the same location
		as this one, you can open this gpgim.xml document in a web browser to see it rendered as HTML
		with clickable links between property and feature definitions. This can be very helpful to
		have open while you are editing this file.
		
		Some notes regarding the following schema-like description:
		 - The number in square brackets '[]', after each XML element name, is the range of allowed
		   number of occurrences of that XML element within its parent XML element.
		 - For example, '[1]' means exactly one occurrence is required and '[0..*]' means any number of occurrences.
		 - Each level of indentation represents a nested, or child, level.
		 - For example, 'Name' is a child XML element of 'FeatureClass'.
		
		The three main elements are:
			PropertyTypeList - the list of property types supported by GPlates.
			PropertyList     - the list of properties (property name-to-type associations) supported by GPlates.
			FeatureClassList - the list of feature classes supported by GPlates.
		
		PropertyTypeList[1]:
			* PropertyTypeList contains the complete list of feature property *types* supported by the GPGIM.
			* Currently PropertyTypeList can only contain Enumeration and NativeProperty elements.
			
			Enumeration[0..*]:
				* An enumeration is a string type that has a finite set of accepted (string) values.
				
				Type[1]:
					* The (namespace qualified) property type - such as 'gpml:ContinentalBoundaryCrustEnumeration'.
					* This should be given a unique name to distinguish it from other enumeration types and native property types.
					* Note that, unlike NativeProperty, an Enumeration can be added to this XML file without requiring modifications to the GPlates source code.
					
				Description[1]:
					* A short description of the enumeration type.
					
				Content[1..*]:
					* Each Content element defines one allowed enumeration value.
					
					Value[1]:
						* An allowed (string) value for the enumeration.
						
					Description[1]:
						* A short description of the enumeration value.
						
				Comment[0..*]:
					* A comment regarding the enumeration.
					* These could potentially be used to generate/update the GPlates data manual and GPGIM website.
					
			NativeProperty[0..*]:
				* A property that is implemented inside the GPlates source code with specific functionality.
				* Most properties in GPlates are native properties (with the exception of enumerations).
				* Developer note: Perhaps in the future this XML file can be extended to allow one to define nested structures of complex native property types - that would require implementing, among others things, an arbitrary Edit Widget that can be built from an XML property type description.
				
				Type[1]:
					* The (namespace qualified) property *non-template* type (such as 'gpml:PolarityChronId') or *template* type (such as 'gpml:Array').
					* Property types that are templates ('TemplateType') are ones that will require a value type (template instantiation) when used in a property (see PropertyList.Property.TemplateType) - however there's no distinction between non-template and template types here.
					
				Description[1]:
					* A short description of the property type.
					
				Comment[0..*]:
					* A comment regarding the native property.
					* These could potentially be used to generate/update the GPlates data manual and GPGIM website.
		
		PropertyList[1]:
			* PropertyList contains the complete list of all properties (that can be referenced by 'FeatureClass's).
			* PropertyList can only contain Property elements.
			
			Property[0..*](attribute 'gpgim:defaultType'):
				* Associates a property 'Name' with one or more property 'Type's.
				* It also defines the conditions under which a property can appear in its feature container such as how many times it can occur in a feature and whether the property can vary with (paleo) time or not.
				* This XML element can also have a 'gpgim:defaultType' XML attribute that defines the default property 'Type'.
				* The 'gpgim:defaultType' attribute is required if there is more than one 'Type' element in a property, otherwise it's optional.
				
				Name[1]:
					* The property name.
					* The property name must unique among all property names listed in PropertyList.
				
				UserFriendlyName[0..1]:
					* A user friendly version of the name of this property.
					* This is what is displayed in the user interface - it is a more human-readable version of the property name.
					* If not specified then it defaults to the local (unqualified) name part of the property name.
					
				Description[1]:
					* A short description of the property.
					
				Type[0..*]:
					* The non-template type of the property (in contrast to template type 'TemplateType').
					* References a NativeProperty or Enumeration (defined in PropertyTypeList).
					* There is usually only one occurrence of 'Type' within a property.
					* Multiple occurrences of 'Type' are typically useful when specifying a
					  'geometry' property that can be, for example, a point, polyline, or polygon, etc.
					* Note that multiple occurrences of 'Type' require the parent 'Property' element to have a 'gpgim:defaultType' attribute.
					* NOTE: There must be at least one 'Type' or 'TemplateType' in the property.
					
				TemplateType[0..*]:
					* The template type of the property (in contrast to non-template type 'Type').
					* Typically used for property types that contain other property types (eg, 'gpml:Array').
					* Most properties won't have a 'TemplateType' (will instead have one or more 'Type's).
					* Multiple occurrences of 'TemplateType' are possible but unlikely.
					* 'TemplateType' is essentially a superset of 'Type' (eg, can be referenced by 'gpgim:defaultType' attribute like 'Type').
					* NOTE: There must be at least one 'Type' or 'TemplateType' in the property.
					
					Type[1]:
						* The template container type of the property (eg, 'gpml:Array').
						* References a NativeProperty (defined in PropertyTypeList).
						* If 'gpgim:defaultType' references a template type then this 'Type' is what it references.
					
					ValueType[1]:
						* The non-template element type within the template container (eg, 'gml:TimePeriod').
						* References a NativeProperty (defined in PropertyTypeList).
						* This is what instantiates a template type, ie, different properties can have different instantiations ('ValueType') of the same template type ('Type').
					
				Multiplicity[1]:
					* The number of times the property can appear (in a feature).
					* Can only contain the following values:
						0..1  // zero or one occurrence
						1     // exactly one occurrence
						0..*  // any number of occurrences
						1..*  // one or more occurrences
						
				TimeDependent[0..*]:
					* Determines whether the property is a time-dependent property or not.
					* Zero occurrences of 'TimeDependent' means the property is *not* time-dependent.
					* Multiple occurrences means the property's dependence on time can
					  be specified in different ways (eg, 'gpml:ConstantValue' or 'gpml:PiecewiseAggregation').
					* The following values are supported:
						gpml:ConstantValue         // Same property value for all time.
						gpml:IrregularSampling     // Irregularly spaced property values, in time, with interpolation inbetween.
						gpml:PiecewiseAggregation  // Multiple time windows - each with own time-dependence (recursive).
					* There is essentially no real difference between having a '<TimeDependent>gpml:ConstantValue</TimeDependent>' and not having a 'TimeDependent' value at all since both result in a property that does not change with time.
					* Traditionally a property was defined as 'gpml:ConstantValue' when there was potential for it to be time-dependent but there was no support for it yet within GPlates.
					* Generally, if you know a property will not change over time then don't give it a 'TimeDependent' element.
					* Support for time-dependent properties is not ubiquitous throughout GPlates so if a property is changed to become time-dependent then this will also need to be implemented within GPlates.
					
				SeeAlso[0..*]:
					* Name of another feature, property or type related to this Property, used for documentation.

				Comment[0..*]:
					* A comment regarding the property.
					* These could potentially be used to generate/update the GPlates data manual and GPGIM website.
		
		FeatureClassList[1]:
			* FeatureClassList contains a list of all feature classes defined by the GPGIM.
			* FeatureClassList can only contain FeatureClass elements.
			
			FeatureClass[0..*](attribute 'gpgim:defaultGeometryProperty'):
				* Each FeatureClass defines a feature type in the GPlates Geological Information Model (GPGIM).
				* This XML element can also have a 'gpgim:defaultGeometryProperty' XML attribute that defines the default geometry property.
				* The 'gpgim:defaultGeometryProperty' attribute is optional and overrides attribute in inherited classes (if defined).
				* The 'gpgim:defaultGeometryProperty' (if specified) must match one of the properties listed in the feature class.
				
				Name[1]:
					* The name of the feature class.
					* This is the same as the "feature type" specified in a GPML file.
					
				Description[1]:
					* A short description of the feature type.
					
				ClassType[1]:
					* The type of feature class.
					* Must be either 'abstract' or 'concrete'.
					* Only 'concrete' classes are visible to the user.
					* Only 'concrete' classes can appear as feature types in a GPML file.
					* 'abstract' classes are typically inherited by many concrete classes.
					* 'concrete' classes can also be inherited from.
					
				Inherits[0..1]:
					* The parent feature class that this feature class (optionally) inherits from.
					* Only single inheritance is supported (can only in herit from at most one parent feature class).
					* However the parent feature class can, in turn, inherit from another (single) feature class and so on.
					* The chain of inheritance typically ends with the feature class 'gml:AbstractFeature'.
					* Each feature class in the chain (optionally) supplies a list of properties that belong to the feature class being defined.
					* Inheritance simply provides a convenient way to inherit properties that are common across a group of feature types.
					* For example, there are many feature types that can form boundaries between plates and hence their feature classes inherit from 'gpml:TectonicSection'.
					
				SeeAlso[0..*]:
					* Name of another feature, property or type related to this Feature, used for documentation.

				Property[0..*]:
					* A property of the feature class.
					* References a Property (defined in PropertyList) by its property name.
					
				Comment[0..*]:
					* A comment regarding the feature class.
					* These could potentially be used to generate/update the GPlates data manual and GPGIM website.

		NOTE: 'gpml:UnclassifiedFeature' is handled as a special-case feature type inside GPlates and
		should not be added to this XML file. Features of type 'gpml:UnclassifiedFeature' can have any number of
		any property listed in this XML file (listed under 'PropertyList').
	-->
		
	<!--
		'gpml:IrregularSampling' is currently only supported for finite rotations (see 'gpml:TotalReconstructionSequence').
		In the future support will be added for non-categorical properties (eg, 'xsi:double') and for geometry properties.
		In the meantime time-dependent geometries should be restricted to 'gpml:ConstantValue' and/or 'gpml:PiecewiseAggregation'.

				Since I don't think formatting XML examples as a Comment would work very well in here, I'll write a comment instead.

				<gpml:Age>
					<gpml:timescale>JBJC2008</gpml:timescale>
					<gpml:namedAge>Late Ordovican</gpml:namedAge>
					<gpml:uncertainty gpml:oldest="461" gpml:youngest="444"/>

				All of those fields, ALL of them, are optional. The values of the <uncertainty> element are generally

			<!-- random notes:
				GpmlAge class. One class deals with both real values and named values, via an enum d_type, similar to GeoTimeInstant.
				Don't modify GeoTimeInstant; it can't know about timescales and therefore can't do comparisons nicely,
				and it only holds the two extra values as enums; we'd want a stringset or something.
				GpmlAge also needs to know about the timescale used.
				The value referenced by 'uncertainty-plus-or-minus' is just a double.

However, the early measurements of isochrons were not very high resolution, and many smaller polarity reversals were missed, only to be discovered later as techniques improved. Rather than renumbering everything as new isochrons were discovered, letters from a-z were added after the number, so M14a refers to the first sub-chron located inside the 14th major chron, and if a polarity reversal were located inside that, it would be named M14aa, and so on.</Comment>

			<Comment>
				This is the first property introduced into the GPGIM to support tracking geological ages in a more complex
				way than simple floating-point absolute ages measured in Ma. 
			</Comment>
			<Comment>
				(TODO) It supports both absolute (numeric) ages and named (e.g. stratigraphic) ages (such as "Late Cretacious",
				or "Maastrichtian") as values. You can tag the age with the name of a specific geological or geomagnetic timescale.
				You can also have an associated uncertainty for the absolute age either as a "plus-or-minus" value in My or
				an oldest and youngest age estimate.
			</Comment>
			<Comment>
				In the future, we may want to migrate a few GPGIM properties that are currently using xsi:double to use
				a gpml:Age instead, but be aware this may cause complications - especially when exporting to formats that
				don't expect anything other than a number to be in their crazy fixed width ASCII format...
				<!-- Further note specially for devs: You may want to use the ToQVariantConverter if one really must export

			<Comment>Not a time-dependent property because, for MidOceanRidge at any rate, that's insanity. A MidOceanRidge -generates- crust. For other boundary features, like SubductionZone, this property is only really used as annotation, (i.e. "this SZ is mostly consuming plate 541") and doesn't need to be over-complex.</Comment>
			<Comment>This property doesn't support multiple plateIds per side for similar reasons to the ones above; in the case of MidOceanRidge, the usefuless of this property hinges on the potential to e.g. interpolate between both sides of the MOR and determine velocity. If more than one plateId per side were supported, topology would have to be taken into consideration, and pieces would have to move at different rates - and so the MOR would have to be broken up into segments, PLATES style. Perhaps when we get segmented MORs in the next release GPGIM, we can consider these extra possibilities. Until then, there's really no point in making this more complex than it needs to be.</Comment>

			<Name>gpml:quality</Name>	<!-- What *is* quality? -->
			<Description>Quality of source data; e.g. are both flanks preserved for Isochrons? are they Synthetic Isochrons?</Description>
			<Comment>
				The need for this property originated from wanting to differentiate between different types of Isochrons,
				however it is potentially a very useful property to have on a wide variety of features. Users can use it to
				assign a 'confidence rating' to Isochrons (and other Features) of various source data qualities, and derive
				a general confidence rating for the entire dataset.
			</Comment>
			<Comment>
				Implementation note: If we're adding multiple enumeration values to gpml:DataQualityEnumeration to cover a wide
				variety of feature types' quality categories, there will inevitably be some values that make no sense for certain
				features; "Both Flanks Preserved" makes sense for an Isochron but not a Basin, for example. The decision was made
				(after much meditation) that this was the least-terrible way to do things; while it may be possible to
				combine several Enumerated types into the one property, there would still not be an easy way to enforce "type
				correctness" on the values other than by making multiple property definitions with multiple names, which is also
				not ideal.

These are free-form text strings, and behave very similarly to the gml:name property; they also possess a 'codeSpace=' attribute to indicate what convention was used when assigning this subcategory to this Feature.</Comment>
			<Comment>Use of the .subcategory property is entirely optional, however it is useful in several situations. There are many possible subcategories of real-world:Features, and these are highly subjective, depending on scientist, dataset, and area of research. Permitting arbitrary subcategorisation in the GPGIM has two benefits. One, GPlates can to continue to treat those real-world:Features as the appropriate gpml:Feature since any subcategory must have the same properties as the parent gpml:Feature. Two, it allows the scientist to have a finer grain of control over the categorisation of those real-world:Features without messing around with XML trying to extend the GPGIM.</Comment>
			<Comment>An example: Seamount s and Guyot s. A Guyot is a special case of Seamount with a flat top. Functionally, they are identical. A problem arises; do we create a GPGIM feature for both of them, or just use Seamount for both cases? Some scientists and datasets may not care about the distinction, and wish to treat everything as a gpml:Seamount without being forced to go over the data and classify everything. On the other hand, a "Guyot Expert" would be very interested in the distinction between the two. The .subcategory property allows you to do this, without forcing you to.</Comment>

			<Comment>A common problem in PLATES datasets is the lack of any deformable geometry. This is often hacked around by creating multiple 'features' for the same real-world thing, for example, an Isochron getting subducted might have have been 'cut up' into multiple PLATES 'IS' features, to simulate the Isochron slowly disappearing. One day, this property will be used by a magical algorithm to undo all the 'cutting up' of features done in data sets for the purpose of hacking deformable geometry into PLATES.</Comment>

			<Comment>The term "Aseismic Ridge" is a very general term used by geoscientists that can apply to almost any nonspecific ridge, with the only defining quality being the inactivity of the feature.</Comment>
			<Comment>For example, sections of a HotSpotTrail might be a chain of Seamounts which are contiguous enough to form a ridge. As well as being Seamounts, the structure can also be termed an "Asesimic Ridge". However, the term can also be easily applied to an Extinct Ridge, or now-inactive remnant spreading ridge (see MidOceanRidge).</Comment>
			<Comment>As far as the GPGIM is concerned, this might make AseismicRidge into an abstract parent of some sort- however, that would imply that all features inheriting from AseismicRidge would be inactive, throughout their entire lifespan. This is unacceptable, especially considering planned improvements to MidOceanRidge to allow for partial segments of a MOR to become inactive, and also considering that a HotSpot's trail is formed of Volcanoes as well as Seamounts that may be active for some time and later become inactive.</Comment>
			<Comment>However, there still exist some situations where the term "AseismicRidge" may be the only term applicable, where a ridge is not known to be any other specific type of ridge. AseismicRidge exists in the GPGIM for this purpose.</Comment>

			<Comment>We already inherit a centerLineOf via AbstractGeologicalContact and AbstractGeologicalPlane. This line is the 'Strike' of the Fault. This should ideally be a directed line where the order of points matters because we need to define what lies on either side.</Comment>
			<Comment>We also inherit the description of the 'Dip' of this Fault via AbstractGeologicalContact and AbstractGeologicalPlane. There are two properties, .dipSide and .dipAngle.</Comment>
			<Comment>There are many different ways to classify a Fault, and they are highly subjective, so remember that we have the 'subcategory' property available.</Comment>
			<Comment>Suggested subcategories are (1) "Thrust" : A Thrust fault is a term often given to a special case of reverse or compression fault where the hanging wall has thrusted completely over the foot wall. Additional information about e.g. Folding (which might warrant additional subcategories), or perhaps describing specific patterns of the Thrust e.g. "Snake Head", make this an ideal candidate for the .subcategory property, (2) "Detachment" : Often used to describe massive movements of rock created from e.g. detachment of rock from a subducting plate which has moved onto the overriding plate.</Comment>
			<Comment>Here's what Dictionary of Earth Sciences p201 has to say: Approximately plane surface of fracture in a rock body, caused by brittle failure, and along which observable relative displacement has occurred between adjacent blocks. Most faults may be broadly classified according to the direction of slip of adjacent blocks into dip-slip, strike-slip, and oblique-slip varieties. The term 'dip-slip fault' comprises both normal and reverse slip faults, and the special cases of low-angle lag and thrust faults. Strike-slip faults {wrench, transform, transcurrent} result from horizontal displacement {dextral or sinistral movements} and on a regional scale may involve transpression and transtension.</Comment>

			<Comment>For magnetic picks, an indication of precisely where on the anomaly the reading was taken is often appended, in the form (o|y)[floating-point number].</Comment>
			<Comment>The first letter indicates Cenozoic or Mesozoic era, followed by a number indicating the chron's position in the sequence. However, the early measurements of isochrons were not very high resolution, and many smaller polarity reversals were missed, only to be discovered later as techniques improved. Rather than renumbering everything as new isochrons were discovered, letters from a-z were added after the number, so M14a refers to the first sub-chron located inside the 14th major chron, and if a polarity reversal were located inside that, it would be named M14aa, and so on.</Comment>
			<Comment>This would result in names such as C34ado0.5, which translates to a Cenozoic isochron, major region 34, sub region a, sub region d, and in the case of this pick the measurement was taken half-way between the "old" and "young" edges.</Comment>

			<Comment>The MidOceanRidge class needs to be pretty flexible. In the PLATES methodology, MOR lines are typically used to represent both the 'spreading' and 'transform' sections of the ridge - and so a lot of older data sets will have rigid MidOceanRidges once they are imported. Ideally, they would use an explicit Transform to join up MidOceanRidge and SubductionZone pieces.</Comment>

			<Comment>The standard model of an orogenic belt is a linear tectonic region in a mountainous region where two plates have collided.

As with MidOceanRidge, the leftPlate and rightPlate properties are set to advise approximately which plate is overriding which.</Comment>
			<Comment>While certainly OrogenicBelt can be treated similarly to SubductionZone, as there was presumably a SubductionZone that pulled the OrogenicBelt into existence (eg India and Asia), there exists potential for there to be no clearly defined overriding and overridden plate. Similar to SubductionZone, we have a .subductingSlab property which is optional.</Comment>

			<Comment>A quite simple, linelike boundary indicating the change between continental and oceanic crust. Since this change is broad and hard to pin down, we expect two main types of continental boundary, an "Inner" ContinentalBoundary and "Outer" ContinentalBoundary. Naturally, which of these labels gets used to describe a gpml:PassiveContinentalBoundary depends largely on the source of the data, who digitized the line, and whether that aspect of the data was recorded in the original source.</Comment>
			<Comment>Does not have to be closed, can be a simple line segment. For closed polygons, you want InstantaneousClosedContinentalBoundary and ClosedContinentalBoundary.</Comment>

			<Comment>The PsuedoFault is the result of the MidOceanRidge that is 'propagating' into the area previously handled by the Extinct Ridge.

			<Comment>An Unconformity is a type of AbstractGeologicalContact. As such, it inherits GeologicalContact's properties '.leftUnit' and '.rightUnit', which allow you to specify what AbstractRockUnits are separated by this Unconformity.</Comment>
			<Comment>An Unconformity is not the same as a Fault. In addition, Unconformities typically have their most interesting detail in cross-section views, such as different layers of sediment - it is never a regional scale contact.</Comment>
			<Comment>Any gml:LineStrings associated with this Unconformity will have to be restricted to a map-view for the time being.</Comment>

			<Comment>Unlike Unconformity and Fault, which deal with fine-grained map views, UnknownContact is for regional scale map views which don't necessarily correspond to physical Faults and Unconformities. It can be used where the reason for the contact is unknown or not specified.</Comment>
