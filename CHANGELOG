GPlates 2.0
===========

Changes since 1.5:

 * Projects and recent sessions:
   * Now saves and restores all layer information:
     * Including layer order, visibility and all settings within each layer (such as colour styles and colour palette filenames).
   * Open projects using File menu, drag'n'drop, double-clicking or command-line.
   * Project name displayed in window title.
   * Copy a project to another computer. For example:
     * Zip up a folder containing project file and associated data files (including colour palette files).
     * Unzip to another computer and open project file in GPlates.
   * Option to locate missing data files (when loading project or recent session):
     * Useful when data files moved after project or session was saved.
   * Option to resolve ambiguous data files (when loading relocated project):
     *Useful when data files exist in both original and relocated locations.
   * GPlates 2.0 can open projects and recent sessions saved by all prior versions of GPlates:
     * However information saved by earlier versions is limited.
   * GPlates 1.5 can open projects and recent sessions saved by GPlates 2.0:
     * However restored information is limited (to what GPlates 1.5 can understand).
   * Handle broken forwards compatibility (broken in GPlates 1.5):
     * By saving a special isolated session state to tag "session_state_version4".
     * Also load/save regular session state to "session_state" tag.
   * Scribe system uses multi-section tag strings:
     * No longer require a C++ class just to transcribe a group of values under the same tag.
   * Support Infinity and NaN (for float/double) in the scribe archive writers and readers:
     * In text and XML formats. Binary already has support due to QDataStream.
   * Internal sessions stored in compressed binary archive instead of uncompressed text archive:
     * Reduce chances of exceeding Windows Registry key limit of 1Mb.
 * New Hellinger tool:
   * A new workflow to determine best-fitting poles by the method of Hellinger:
     * Import and export data files compatible with the FORTRAN programs of Chang and co-workers.
     * Edit and create magnetic pick data points, via the canvas or tabularly via the Hellinger dialog.
     * Adjust segmentation of magnetic picks.
     * Enable/disable magnetic picks from inclusion in the fitting algorithms.
     * Specify pole and angle estimates via the canvas or via the Hellinger dialog.
     * Perform fitting using a python implementation the FORTRAN programs.
     * Visualise resulting fit and uncertainty on the canvas.
     * Export fit and uncertainty data to text file.
 * Deformation:
   * Topological networks:
     * Boundary is similar to a topological closed plate boundary, but also has:
       * A deforming interior region (due to individual deforming points).
       * Optional interior rigid blocks.
     * Build New Network Topology tool now publicly available (without requiring command-line switch to enable).
     * Export topological network boundaries in general Resolved Topologies export.
     * Query and visualise velocities and strain rates at arbitrary points in networks.
       * Strain rates use logarithmic colour scale.
     * Optionally display total (accumulated) strain at arbitrary points:
       * Displays principal components and orientation.
       * Outward-facing red arrows for extension.
       * Inward-facing blue arrows for compression.
   * Reconstructing regular features using topologies:
     * Use both topological rigid plates and deforming networks to reconstructed regular features.
     * Incrementally reconstructs by plate ID in topological rigid plates.
     * Incrementally deforms in topological deforming networks.
     * Begin incremental reconstruction at a feature's time of appearance, digitisation time or present day.
     * Use specific topological layers or default to all loaded topologies.
     * Optional to detect lifetime of each point in a geometry:
       * Oceanic points appear (mid-ocean ridges) and disappear (subduct).
       * Based on convergence velocity and distance to plate boundary during a plate/network transition.
   * Scalar coverages:
     * A new geometry type in a new layer type.
     * Each point in a multipoint/polyline/polygon has a scalar value associated with it.
     * For example, visualise mid-ocean ridge spreading rates and asymmetry calculated externally using pyGPlates.
   * Crustal thinning:
     * A specific type of scalar coverage containing crustal thickness values.
     * GPlates recognises this coverage type internally:
       * Uses deformation strain rates to evolve crustal thickness over time.
     * An input dialog generates initial crustal thickness points:
       * Uniform distribution of points within a topological rigid plate or deforming network boundary (with optional random offset).
       * Specify initial constant/flat crustal thickness at a past geological time.
     * Choose from a selection of built-in colour palettes to visualise crustal thickness variations over time.
     * Export crustal thickness values to GMT(xy) or GPML format.
     * Also added a separate export for deformation (strain rates).
 * Official public release of volume visualisation:
   * No longer require command-line switch to enable importing of 3D scalar fields.
 * Net rotation export:
   * Calculates and exports net rotation of the lithosphere (based on the method of Torsvik et al., 2010) using global coverages of dynamic plate polygons.
   * Net rotations are exported via the standard "Exportâ€¦" tool, and by selecting the "Net rotation" export type.
   * Any dynamic plate-polygon data sets currently active in GPlates will be used as the basis for net rotation calculations. 
 * Improved OGR spatial reference system (SRS) support:
     * More complete support for OGR-supported files (e.g. ESRI shape file, OGR-GMT and others) which provide spatial reference system / projection information.
     * Any SRSs supported by the PROJ4 library should now be accepted by GPlates.
     * When saving to a file which had a non-WGS84 SRS associated with it, GPlates will prompt the user to export in either the original SRS, or in WGS84.
     * All other forms of file export in GPlates continue to use WGS84.
 * Improved handling of import / export directories
   * Now stores the last used directory for Project files.
   * More fine-grained support for both Feature Collection and Project folder preferences (can adjust through the Preferences (Ctrl+,) dialog).
 * Visibility of all layers can be toggled as a group using the new visibility icons in the Layers dialog.
 * Support non-zero central meridian in dateline wrapper.
 * In Pole Manipulation tool, only render highlights on geometries in visible layers.
 * Half-stage reconstruct method now defaults to a new version (3) of half-stage rotation calculation:
   * First reconstructs using only left plate to digitisation time of mid-ocean ridge (if digitised in GPlates 2.0 or above).
   * Then half-stage rotates from digitisation time to reconstruction time.
   * Changes to spreading asymmetry no longer move ridge to incorrect position (at digitisation time).
 * Can adjust line width in Graticule settings.
 * Assign Plate IDs dialog:
   * Time of appearance and disappearance are now separate options.
   * Added conjugate plate ID option.
   * Added option to only copy/assign requested feature properties that are allowed (by GPGIM) for the partitioned feature type.
 * No longer overwrite comment in rotation pole when using Pole Manipulation tool.
 * Intersection and distance queries:
   * Calculate minimum distance between two geometries:
     * Each geometry can be a point, multipoint, polyline or polygon.
     * Can use optional distance threshold and optionally returns closest positions and indices (into points or segments).
     * Polygons can be treated as non-solid (outline) or solid (geometries inside polygon are zero distance).
     * Uses a binary bounding small circle tree for polylines/polygons for efficient early rejection.
       * Traverses tree and uses minimum distance between two small circles.
   * Calculate optimal bounding small circle around two other small circles.
   * Added centroid calculation function for polygons/polylines based on weighting the segment lengths.
   * Have separate boundary and interior centroids for polygons:
     * The latter being closer to the centre-of-mass of polygon interior.
   * Fixed spherical version of centroid calculation for polygons:
     * For clockwise polygons the centroid was on the opposite side of the globe.
   * Point-in-polygon test defaults to adaptive:
     * Starts off low-speed then moves to medium and high speed as more point-in-polygon calls are made.
   * Can interpolate two polylines along small circles about a (stage pole) rotation axis.
   * Can tessellate polylines and polygons.
   * Added tessellation to dateline wrapper:
     * Useful for polygons crossing dateline in non-rectangular 2D map views (polygon section along dateline is curved).
 * Added support for donut polygons (containing interior holes):
   * GPML, OGR (shapefile), PLATES (line) and GMT(xy) readers/writers supported.
   * Feature query/edit dialogs display interior holes.
   * Supported by raster reconstruction, raster co-registration and filled polygons display.
   * Also supported by 3D scalar fields (cross-sections, surface masks and polygon walls).
   * Also supported by for point-in-polygon test, spherical area, centroid, orientation and dateline wrapper.
 * Colour palette improvements:
   * Available in raster, 3D scalar field and scalar coverage layers.
   * Remap the range using mean and standard deviation of the layer data (raster, 3D scalar field or scalar coverage).
   * Added a variety of built-in colour palettes based on ColorBrewer sequential and diverging colour scales.
 * Raster reconstruction improvements:
   * Connecting raster layer to polygons much more stable and noticeably faster (using our own polygon mesh refinement).
   * No more seams/cracks in raster between adjacent polygons (matching tessellation of shared polygon boundaries).
 * Added image compression to raster export (colour and numerical) for TIFF and Erdas formats.
 * Resolving topologies can also generate non-overlapping sub-segments shared by adjacent topology boundaries/networks:
   * No duplication/overlap in this set of segments (as opposed to boundary segments of each resolved boundary/network).
 * Only those layers and features that can actually contribute to resolved topologies are reconstructed:
   * Improves performance noticeably when topologies are used to reconstruct regular features.
 * Support partitioning of point/multi-point/polyline/polygon scalar coverages when assigning plate IDs.
 * Removed option to assign plate IDs to each sub-geometry of a feature. Now the only two options are:
   * Assigning based on the polygon that most overlap the *entire* geometry of a feature (all its sub-geometries combined), and
   * Partitioning into polygons.
 * Added Earth class for parameters such as Earth radius.
 * Topology geometry and network layers also support fill opacity/intensity.
 * Can merge selected (or all) rotation layers into one layer:
   * Avoids user having to manually connect multiple rotation files into a single rotation layer.
 * Added velocity delta-time options to velocity layer:
   * Can change delta-time interval, and choose 't+dt->t', 't->t-dt' or 't+dt/2->t-dt/2'.
   * Attempt to calculate non-zero velocities, when one of the times in delta interval is negative, by shifting time interval.
 * Can now import and register 'internal' Python scripts (stored in Qt resource files embedded inside application):
   * This will mean that important scripts such as colouring scripts will always get registered.
   * No longer need to ensure they are installed in the correct place on the user's file system for example.
 * Allow Python colouring classes to declare their own set of 'built in' config variants.
 * Added new colour styles with arbitrary colours (HSV configurable) and properties.
 * Colour vector geometries on the rear of the globe the same as the background colour:
   * Results in less visual interference/clutter for geometries on the front of the globe (when globe is semi-transparent).
 * Can create conjugate isochron linked to original (cannot yet follow links in GUI though).
 * Store +/- Infinity in GeoTimeInstant (for distant past/future).
 * GPlates Geological Information Model (GPGIM) updates:
   * Added stratigraphic timescale.
   * Added support for named ages (in contrast to absolute ages) with timescale information and uncertainty tracking:

 * Use the North pole (90,0) as the axis for zero-angle (identity) rotations when writing out PLATES rotation file.
 * When exporting reconstructed/resolved geometries to a single output file, retain shapefile attributes if the associated features all came from a single file.
 * OGR geometry exporter can write multiple geometries as a single feature (if geometries came from same feature).
 * Added progress bar when adding depth layers during 3D scalar field import (and when adding time sequence during time-dependent raster import).
 * Remove depth layer raster cache files after importing 3D scalar field if the cache files didn't exist prior to the import:
   * Frees the user's disk space of the cache files generated during import process.
 * When importing 3D scalar field, read georeferencing and SRS from first depth layer raster (if has that info):
   * Otherwise ask user for georeferencing (and assume WGS84 SRS).
 * Compiling software:
   * Remove dependency on ImageMagick.
   * Add "/LARGEADDRESSAWARE" for Win32 builds to enable 4Gb (versus 2Gb) for 32-bit builds on a 64-bit Windows OS.

 * Fixed so that points equal (within epsilon) to a great circle arc's start point should be considered to lie on the arc.
 * Fixed another infinite loop bug in polyline intersections code (two overlapping arcs assumed pointing in wrong direction relative to each other).
 * Fix two polylines intersecting at a common vertex (prevent tunnelling through each other without being noticed).
 * Fixed rendering of filled polylines in 2D map views.
 * Fixed bug in polyline/polygon (outline) centroid caused by point-in-polygon test incorrectly passing polygon consisted of coincident points.

 * No longer update stage pole location when Enable Pole checkbox is not checked (also update when checkbox is checked again).
 * Fixed velocity layer options not updating when changing the solve-velocities-method.
 * Fixed azimuthal equal area projection exception when unprojecting a point that is coincident with the centre of projection.
 * Fixed flickering cross-sections in 3D scalar fields (bug in mapping OpenGL buffers for streaming).

 * Fixed crash when changing draw style configuration parameters in GUI or when removing a draw style in GUI.
 * Fixed infinite recursion bug in model notification. This was noticed when importing a raster.
 * Fixed SVG export of 3D scalar field isosurfaces (on Mac OS X) which appeared to be incorrectly rotated and offset from centre of globe.
 * Fixed 3D scalar field cross-sections generating 'invalid operation' in OpenGL on Mac OS X (during draw call due to shader program being invalid).
 * No longer require first and last point of GML polygon to be identical (when reading GPML file):
   * Some GPML files have only three points (instead of the required 4 points - since first and last should be identical) since really only need 3 points for a polygon.
 * No longer show the GPGIM version warning dialog when overwriting a GPML file with an older version.
 * Fixed Move Vertex tool (and other geometry tools) not working with flowlines.

     * Supports vertically-extruded walls at surface polygon boundaries.
     * Render iso-surface single/double deviation window on vertical walls as isolines.
   * Globe is semi-transparent when rendering 3D scalar field:
     * Opaque surface geometries (polylines, rasters, filled polygons) can occlude scalar field.
     * Scalar field is not ray-traced for those pixels occluded by surface geometries.
 * Deformation:
   * Calculates instantaneous strain rates for each triangle in topological network triangulation.
   * Displays dilitation (and second invariant of) strain rate as palette coloured triangles.

   * Velocity now calculated using rotation tree(s) of plate/network-nodes (that velocity point is inside).
     * Previously used default rotation layer.
   * Velocities work with network interiors that are resolved topological *lines* (ie, two levels of velocity indirection).
   * "Reconstructed Geometries" layers connected to (deformed by) topological network layers cannot provide topological sections for any topology layers.
   * Added optional topological sections layer connections to topology layers.
     * Enables duplicating topology layers but with different topological sections.

   * Preference given to 'GPGIM_TYPE' if present with fall back to 'TYPE'.
   * Both saved on writing with 'TYPE' to eventually be phased out in a future release.
 * New resolved topological 'lines':
   * Used to create dynamic polylines (instead of dynamic polygons).
   * Can only reference static reconstructed features.
   * Dynamic plate polygons and networks can reference dynamic lines in their boundaries (and interiors).

   * No longer need to specify 'age' as the band name when importing age grid raster.
   * Can still connect to another raster layer (to help smooth its reconstruction).

GPlates 0.9.10
==============

Changes since 0.9.9:

TODO: Change this to list actual changes implemented (this is currently a copy of the release email).

This release is a preview of raster reconstructions and layers. 
We have implemented raster reconstructions to take advantage of
the majority of graphics systems so please let us know if you are
having difficulty on your system. 

If you want to reconstruct a raster, and try out the new layers system, the sample data
in this release contains the following files to demonstrate this: 
 * present-day plate polygons (in "SampleData/FeatureCollections/StaticPolygons/") 
   - "Global_Earthbyte_GPlates_PresentDay_PlatePolygons_20100826.gpml", 
 * a rotation file (in "SampleData/FeatureCollections/Rotations/") 
   - "Global_Earthbyte_GPlates_Rotation_20091015.rot", 
 * a global marine gravity raster (in "SampleData/Rasters/") 
   - "DNSC08GRA_6m.gpml", 
 * an ocean-floor age grid (in "SampleData/Rasters/") 
   - "agegrid_6m.gpml".
To reconstruct the above gravity raster load all the above files into GPlates 
using "Open Feature Collection" from the "File" menu. And then connect the 
present-day plate polygons to the "Polygon features" input channel of the
gravity raster. The gravity raster should now reconstruct.
For a high-detail reconstruction you can also connect the age grid raster
to the "Age grid feature" input channel of the gravity raster.
You can see an example screenshot of the layers window used for
this purpose at http://www.gplates.org/screenshots.html
(see http://www.gplates.org/screenshots/0.9.10/LayersWindow.png).
Note that you may also need to import a raster if it does not have
an associated ".gpml" file.
Also note that the age grid raster does not display since it has been
imported as an age grid rather than a regular raster - this is so it
can be used to assist the reconstruction of other rasters.

GPlates 0.9.9
=============

Changes since 0.9.8:

 * Added new Paleomagnetic functionality:
   * Ability to create a Virtual Geomeomagnetic Pole (VGP) feature by
     manually entering its parameters/attributes (such as pole position),
   * Ability to generate a total rotation pole that can be manually
     inserted into a rotation file to make adjustments between
     the VGP and the geographic pole,
   * Ability to specify when Virtual Geomeomagnetic Pole features are
     displayed (using a user-specified age range or time window).
 * Colouring improvements:
   * Ability to preview the effects of each colouring option,
   * Ability to load colour tables from GMT CPT files for user-defined colouring,
   * Ability to change colouring globally or per feature collection.
 * Added ability to split a feature into two features.
 * Added ability to delete a feature.
 * Added ability to clone a feature.
 * Added ability to clone geometry for input to a digitisation tool.
 * Added support for "unsaved changes" to feature collections:
   * Feature collections with unsaved changes are highlighted red in the
     "Manage Feature Collections" dialog,
   * New feature collections not yet saved are highlighted orange,
   * "unsaved changes" and "file error" icons appear at the bottom-right
     of GPlates when necessary,
   * Exiting GPlates brings up a dialog with options to save unsaved changes.
 * Export functionality improvements:
   * Combined time-sequence export and single-snapshot export into one,
   * Added export of the globe view as image(s),
   * Added two rotation exports ("Equivalent" and "Relative" that export
     total rotation poles for each plate id relative to the anchor plate,
     for "Equivalent", and relative to the next plate in the circuit,
     for "Relative"),
   * Added ability to control export filenames by editing the filename template.
 * Improvements to cookie-cutting and assigning plate ids:
   * Can cookie-cut using regular features containing static polygon geometry
     in addition to using topological closed plate boundary features,
   * Can assign time of appearance/disappearance in addition to plate ids.
 * Added option to rotate daughter/children plates in the
   "Modify Reconstruction Pole" tool.
 * Can generate CitcomS 3.1 meshes inside GPlates.
 * Added conjugate plate id to the "Create Feature" dialog for those features
   requiring one.
 * Topological closed plate boundary improvements including:
   * Automated reversal of topological line sections,
   * Can add same topological line section multiple times to a boundary.
 * Added support for feature ids in Shapefiles (allows features referenced by
   topological closed plate boundaries to be exported/imported as shapefiles).
 * Can read/write 4-digit plate id from/to PLATES line format files.
 * Added assign plate ids command to command-line version of GPlates and
   improved flexibility of file conversion and reconstruct command-line options.
 * Root of time-dependent raster filenames can vary, for example,
   "imageA" and "imageB" in "imageA-0.jpg" and "imageB-1.jpg".
 * Added multipoint support to PLATES line format (eg, hotspots).
 * Added unit test framework.


GPlates 0.9.8
=============

Changes since 0.9.7.1:

 * The new 0.9.8 release of GPlates can use a loaded topological plate polygon
   data set to "cookie-cut" a feature collection and assign Plate IDs to the
   data based on which plate polygon intersects them. This enables users to load
   data files that do not have Plate ID or reconstruction time information, and
   then manipulate that data with the loaded reconstruction model.
   
 * Support for virtual geomagnetic pole data is ongoing. As a special preview of
   GPlates paleo-mag functionality, GPlates is now able to import data from the
   IAGA Global Paleomagnetic Database created by Mike McElhinny and Jo Lock,
   later maintained by Sergei Pisarevsky. GPlates can then assign Plate IDs from
   a topological plate polygon data set and then display the reconstructed
   virtual geomagnetic pole locations on the globe. The database is available
   online here: http://www.ngu.no/geodynamics/gpmdb/ . In future releases, full
   editing capabilities and support for a wide range of data (such as the MagIC
   database) will be forthcoming.
   
 * Small circle arcs can be rendered by GPlates to indicate the error bounds of
   virtual geomagnetic poles.
   
 * Development on new colouring options has started. GPlates' default Plate ID
   colouring scheme has been tweaked, and a new colour by Plate ID region
   colouring scheme has been created.
   
 * The Modify Reconstruction Pole tool can now constrain the latitude of the
   pole manipulation while interactively making adjustments.
   
 * The topological capabilities of GPlates are undergoing constant improvement
   and expansion. As a consequence of these ongoing developments, GPlates now
   links with CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. This will
   enable many impressive extensions to the topology tools in the future.


GPlates 0.9.7.1
===============

Changes since 0.9.5:

 * GPlates can now utilise a full screen mode, which is available by pressing
   F11. This mode is ideal for presenting data and animations using GPlates. It
   makes the user interface more minimalistic, granting a greater amount of
   screen space to the main view. This is especially useful on low-resolution
   devices such as projectors.
   
 * A new Measure Distance Tool has been implemented, allowing precise
   measurement of the distance between any two chosen points. It also interacts
   with the digitisation and feature-selecting tools, to enable easy inspection
   of the distances along polyline geometries and polyline segments.
   
 * Exporting the Total Reconstruction Poles table to CSV can now be done with a
   choice of delimiters, and more closely adheres to the CSV specifications.
   
 * The previous 0.9.6 release involved the integration of the plate polygon
   closure workflow into the main stable branch of GPlates. With 0.9.7.1,
   additional work has gone into improving the user experience and making the
   topology algorithms more intelligent, and enables the export of geometry
   sub-segments involved in topologies.
