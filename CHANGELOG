GPlates 0.9.9
=============

Changes since 0.9.8:

 * Added support for feature ids in Shapefiles (allows features referenced by
   topological closed plate boundaries to be exported/imported as shapefiles).
 * Added conjugate plate id to the "Create Feature" dialog for those features
   requiring one.
 * Can read/write 4-digit plate id from/to PLATES line format files.
 * Added unit test framework.
 * Added assign plate ids command to command-line version of GPlates and
   improved flexibility of file conversion and reconstruct command-line options.
 * Added option to rotate daughter/children plates in the
   Modify Reconstruction Pole tool.
 * Added multipoint support to PLATES line format (eg, hotspots).
 * Can generate CitcomS 3.1 meshes inside GPlates.
 * Added ability to split a feature into two features.
 * Added ability to clone a feature.
 * Added ability to clone geometry and use as input to the digitisation tools.
 * Topological closed plate boundary improvements including:
   * Manual reversal of topological line sections no longer required,
   * Add same topological line section multiple times to a boundary.
 * Added significant colouring improvements:
   * Ability to preview the effects of each colouring option,
   * Ability to load colour tables from GMT CPT files,
   * Ability to change colouring globally or per feature collection.
 * Significant export functionality improvements:
   * Combined time-sequence export and single-snapshot export into one,
   * Added export of the globe view as image(s),
   * Added two rotation exports ("Equivalent" and "Relative" that export
     total rotation poles for each plate id relative to the anchor plate,
     for "Equivalent", and relative to the next plate in the circuit,
     for "Relative"),
   * Added ability to control export filenames by editing the filename template.
 * Added significant support for "unsaved changes" to feature collections:
   * Feature collections with unsaved changes are highlighted red in the
     "Manage Feature Collections" dialog,
   * New feature collections not yet saved are highlighted orange,
   * "unsaved changes" and "file error" icons appear at the bottom-right
     of GPlates when necessary,
   * Exiting GPlates brings up a dialog with options to save unsaved changes.
  * Improvements to cookie-cutting and assigning plate ids:
    * In addition to using topological closed plate boundary features
	  can now use regular features with static polygon geometry to
	  cookie-cut and/or assign plate ids to other features,
	* Can assign time of appearance/disappearance to partitioned features
	  in addition to plate ids.


GPlates 0.9.8
=============

Changes since 0.9.7.1:

 * The new 0.9.8 release of GPlates can use a loaded topological plate polygon
   data set to "cookie-cut" a feature collection and assign Plate IDs to the
   data based on which plate polygon intersects them. This enables users to load
   data files that do not have Plate ID or reconstruction time information, and
   then manipulate that data with the loaded reconstruction model.
   
 * Support for virtual geomagnetic pole data is ongoing. As a special preview of
   GPlates paleo-mag functionality, GPlates is now able to import data from the
   IAGA Global Paleomagnetic Database created by Mike McElhinny and Jo Lock,
   later maintained by Sergei Pisarevsky. GPlates can then assign Plate IDs from
   a topological plate polygon data set and then display the reconstructed
   virtual geomagnetic pole locations on the globe. The database is available
   online here: http://www.ngu.no/geodynamics/gpmdb/ . In future releases, full
   editing capabilities and support for a wide range of data (such as the MagIC
   database) will be forthcoming.
   
 * Small circle arcs can be rendered by GPlates to indicate the error bounds of
   virtual geomagnetic poles.
   
 * Development on new colouring options has started. GPlates' default Plate ID
   colouring scheme has been tweaked, and a new colour by Plate ID region
   colouring scheme has been created.
   
 * The Modify Reconstruction Pole tool can now constrain the latitude of the
   pole manipulation while interactively making adjustments.
   
 * The topological capabilities of GPlates are undergoing constant improvement
   and expansion. As a consequence of these ongoing developments, GPlates now
   links with CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. This will
   enable many impressive extensions to the topology tools in the future.


GPlates 0.9.7.1
===============

Changes since 0.9.5:

 * GPlates can now utilise a full screen mode, which is available by pressing
   F11. This mode is ideal for presenting data and animations using GPlates. It
   makes the user interface more minimalistic, granting a greater amount of
   screen space to the main view. This is especially useful on low-resolution
   devices such as projectors.
   
 * A new Measure Distance Tool has been implemented, allowing precise
   measurement of the distance between any two chosen points. It also interacts
   with the digitisation and feature-selecting tools, to enable easy inspection
   of the distances along polyline geometries and polyline segments.
   
 * Exporting the Total Reconstruction Poles table to CSV can now be done with a
   choice of delimiters, and more closely adheres to the CSV specifications.
   
 * The previous 0.9.6 release involved the integration of the plate polygon
   closure workflow into the main stable branch of GPlates. With 0.9.7.1,
   additional work has gone into improving the user experience and making the
   topology algorithms more intelligent, and enables the export of geometry
   sub-segments involved in topologies.
