GPlates 0.9.10
==============

Changes since 0.9.9:

TODO: Change this to list actual changes implemented (this is currently a copy of the release email).

This release is a preview of raster reconstructions and layers. 
We have implemented raster reconstructions to take advantage of
the majority of graphics systems so please let us know if you are
having difficulty on your system. 

If you want to reconstruct a raster, and try out the new layers system, the sample data
in this release contains the following files to demonstrate this: 
 * present-day plate polygons (in "SampleData/FeatureCollections/StaticPolygons/") 
   - "Global_Earthbyte_GPlates_PresentDay_PlatePolygons_20100826.gpml", 
 * a rotation file (in "SampleData/FeatureCollections/Rotations/") 
   - "Global_Earthbyte_GPlates_Rotation_20091015.rot", 
 * a global marine gravity raster (in "SampleData/Rasters/") 
   - "DNSC08GRA_6m.gpml", 
 * an ocean-floor age grid (in "SampleData/Rasters/") 
   - "agegrid_6m.gpml".
To reconstruct the above gravity raster load all the above files into GPlates 
using "Open Feature Collection" from the "File" menu. And then connect the 
present-day plate polygons to the "Polygon features" input channel of the
gravity raster. The gravity raster should now reconstruct.
For a high-detail reconstruction you can also connect the age grid raster
to the "Age grid feature" input channel of the gravity raster.
You can see an example screenshot of the layers window used for
this purpose at http://www.gplates.org/screenshots.html
(see http://www.gplates.org/screenshots/0.9.10/LayersWindow.png).
Note that you may also need to import a raster if it does not have
an associated ".gpml" file.
Also note that the age grid raster does not display since it has been
imported as an age grid rather than a regular raster - this is so it
can be used to assist the reconstruction of other rasters.


GPlates 0.9.9.1
===============

Changes since 0.9.9:

 * Fixed incorrect reversal of subduction polarity when exporting topologies, 
 * Fixed error in calculated velocities, 
 * Fixed number of exported velocity samples not matching number of grid points,

 * Fixed duplicate string in filename of exported topologies. 


GPlates 0.9.9
=============

Changes since 0.9.8:

 * Added new Paleomagnetic functionality:
   * Ability to create a Virtual Geomeomagnetic Pole (VGP) feature by
     manually entering its parameters/attributes (such as pole position),
   * Ability to generate a total rotation pole that can be manually
     inserted into a rotation file to make adjustments between
     the VGP and the geographic pole,
   * Ability to specify when Virtual Geomeomagnetic Pole features are
     displayed (using a user-specified age range or time window).
 * Colouring improvements:
   * Ability to preview the effects of each colouring option,
   * Ability to load colour tables from GMT CPT files for user-defined colouring,
   * Ability to change colouring globally or per feature collection.
 * Added ability to split a feature into two features.
 * Added ability to delete a feature.
 * Added ability to clone a feature.
 * Added ability to clone geometry for input to a digitisation tool.
 * Added support for "unsaved changes" to feature collections:
   * Feature collections with unsaved changes are highlighted red in the
     "Manage Feature Collections" dialog,
   * New feature collections not yet saved are highlighted orange,
   * "unsaved changes" and "file error" icons appear at the bottom-right
     of GPlates when necessary,
   * Exiting GPlates brings up a dialog with options to save unsaved changes.
 * Export functionality improvements:
   * Combined time-sequence export and single-snapshot export into one,
   * Added export of the globe view as image(s),
   * Added two rotation exports ("Equivalent" and "Relative" that export
     total rotation poles for each plate id relative to the anchor plate,
     for "Equivalent", and relative to the next plate in the circuit,
     for "Relative"),
   * Added ability to control export filenames by editing the filename template.
 * Improvements to cookie-cutting and assigning plate ids:
   * Can cookie-cut using regular features containing static polygon geometry
     in addition to using topological closed plate boundary features,
   * Can assign time of appearance/disappearance in addition to plate ids.
 * Added option to rotate daughter/children plates in the
   "Modify Reconstruction Pole" tool.
 * Can generate CitcomS 3.1 meshes inside GPlates.
 * Added conjugate plate id to the "Create Feature" dialog for those features
   requiring one.
 * Topological closed plate boundary improvements including:
   * Automated reversal of topological line sections,
   * Can add same topological line section multiple times to a boundary.
 * Added support for feature ids in Shapefiles (allows features referenced by
   topological closed plate boundaries to be exported/imported as shapefiles).
 * Can read/write 4-digit plate id from/to PLATES line format files.
 * Added assign plate ids command to command-line version of GPlates and
   improved flexibility of file conversion and reconstruct command-line options.
 * Root of time-dependent raster filenames can vary, for example,
   "imageA" and "imageB" in "imageA-0.jpg" and "imageB-1.jpg".
 * Added multipoint support to PLATES line format (eg, hotspots).
 * Added unit test framework.


GPlates 0.9.8
=============

Changes since 0.9.7.1:

 * The new 0.9.8 release of GPlates can use a loaded topological plate polygon
   data set to "cookie-cut" a feature collection and assign Plate IDs to the
   data based on which plate polygon intersects them. This enables users to load
   data files that do not have Plate ID or reconstruction time information, and
   then manipulate that data with the loaded reconstruction model.
   
 * Support for virtual geomagnetic pole data is ongoing. As a special preview of
   GPlates paleo-mag functionality, GPlates is now able to import data from the
   IAGA Global Paleomagnetic Database created by Mike McElhinny and Jo Lock,
   later maintained by Sergei Pisarevsky. GPlates can then assign Plate IDs from
   a topological plate polygon data set and then display the reconstructed
   virtual geomagnetic pole locations on the globe. The database is available
   online here: http://www.ngu.no/geodynamics/gpmdb/ . In future releases, full
   editing capabilities and support for a wide range of data (such as the MagIC
   database) will be forthcoming.
   
 * Small circle arcs can be rendered by GPlates to indicate the error bounds of
   virtual geomagnetic poles.
   
 * Development on new colouring options has started. GPlates' default Plate ID
   colouring scheme has been tweaked, and a new colour by Plate ID region
   colouring scheme has been created.
   
 * The Modify Reconstruction Pole tool can now constrain the latitude of the
   pole manipulation while interactively making adjustments.
   
 * The topological capabilities of GPlates are undergoing constant improvement
   and expansion. As a consequence of these ongoing developments, GPlates now
   links with CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. This will
   enable many impressive extensions to the topology tools in the future.


GPlates 0.9.7.1
===============

Changes since 0.9.5:

 * GPlates can now utilise a full screen mode, which is available by pressing
   F11. This mode is ideal for presenting data and animations using GPlates. It
   makes the user interface more minimalistic, granting a greater amount of
   screen space to the main view. This is especially useful on low-resolution
   devices such as projectors.
   
 * A new Measure Distance Tool has been implemented, allowing precise
   measurement of the distance between any two chosen points. It also interacts
   with the digitisation and feature-selecting tools, to enable easy inspection
   of the distances along polyline geometries and polyline segments.
   
 * Exporting the Total Reconstruction Poles table to CSV can now be done with a
   choice of delimiters, and more closely adheres to the CSV specifications.
   
 * The previous 0.9.6 release involved the integration of the plate polygon
   closure workflow into the main stable branch of GPlates. With 0.9.7.1,
   additional work has gone into improving the user experience and making the
   topology algorithms more intelligent, and enables the export of geometry
   sub-segments involved in topologies.
