# The Plan:
#
# Read in the logs for multiple files, spit out a nice ChangeLog that
# mirrors the information entered during `cvs commit'.
#
# The problem presents some challenges. In an ideal world, we could
# detect files with the same author, log message, and checkin time --
# each <filelist, author, time, logmessage> would be a changelog entry.
# We'd sort them; and spit them out.  Unfortunately, CVS is *not atomic*
# so checkins can span a range of times.  Also, the directory structure
# could be hierarchical.
#
# Another question is whether we really want to have the ChangeLog
# exactly reflect commits. An author could issue two related commits,
# with different log entries, reflecting a single logical change to the
# source. GNU style ChangeLogs group these under a single author/date.
# We try to do the same.
#
# So, we parse the output of `cvs log', storing log messages in a
# multilevel hash that stores the mapping:
#   directory => author => time => message => filelist
# As we go, we notice "nearby" commit times and store them together
# (i.e., under the same timestamp), so they appear in the same log
# entry.
#
# When we've read all the logs, we twist this mapping into
# a time => author => message => filelist mapping for each directory.
#
# If we're not using the `--distributed' flag, the directory is always
# considered to be `./', even as descend into subdirectories.

        #    ----------------------------
        #

        # log message and a *two*-line log message whose first line is

        # write log messages like that, and just toss a "branches:"
        # line if we see it but are not showing branches.  I hope no

      # number, tags, branches, etc.  The reason to have these things

Generate GNU-style ChangeLogs in CVS working copies.

Notes about the output format(s):

   The default output of cvs2cl.pl is designed to be compact, formally
   unambiguous, but still easy for humans to read.  It is largely
   self-explanatory, I hope; the one abbreviation that might not be
   obvious is "utags".  That stands for "universal tags" -- a
   universal tag is one held by all the files in a given change entry.

   If you need output that's easy for a program to parse, use the
   --xml option.  Note that with XML output, just about all available
   information is included with each change entry, whether you asked
   for it or not, on the theory that your parser can ignore anything
   it's not looking for.

Notes about the options and arguments (the actual options are listed
last in this usage message):

  * The -I and -F options may appear multiple times.

  * To follow trunk revisions, use "-F trunk" ("-F TRUNK" also works).
    This is okay because no would ever, ever be crazy enough to name a
    branch "trunk", right?  Right.

  * For the -U option, the UFILE should be formatted like
    CVSROOT/users. That is, each line of UFILE looks like this
       jrandom:jrandom@red-bean.com
    or maybe even like this
       jrandom:'Jesse Q. Random <jrandom@red-bean.com>'
    Don't forget to quote the portion after the colon if necessary.

  * Many people want to filter by date.  To do so, invoke cvs2cl.pl
    like this:
       cvs2cl.pl -l "-d'DATESPEC'"
    where DATESPEC is any date specification valid for "cvs log -d".
    (Note that CVS 1.10.7 and below requires there be no space between
    -d and its argument).

    Some examples (working on UNIX shells):

      # logs after 6th March, 2003 (inclusive)
      cvs2cl.pl -l "-d'>2003-03-06'"
      # logs after 4:34PM 6th March, 2003 (inclusive)
      cvs2cl.pl -l "-d'>2003-03-06 16:34'"
      # logs between 4:46PM 6th March, 2003 (exclusive) and
      # 4:34PM 6th March, 2003 (inclusive)
      cvs2cl.pl -l "-d'2003-03-06 16:46>2003-03-06 16:34'"

    Some examples (on non-UNIX shells):

      # Reported to work on windows xp/2000
      cvs2cl.pl -l  "-d"">2003-10-18;today<"""

   Dates/times are interpreted in the local time zone.

   Remember to quote the argument to `-l' so that your shell doesn't interpret
   spaces as argument separators.

   See the 'Common Options' section of the cvs manual ('info cvs' on UNIX-like
   systems) for more information.

   Note that the rules for quoting under windows shells are different.

                               given tags are ignored.
  --show-tag TAG               Log only individual changes that are associated
                               with a given tag.  May be repeated, if so,
                               changes that are associated with any of the
                               given tags are logged.
  --delta FROM_TAG:TO_TAG      Attempt a delta between two tags (since FROM_TAG
                               up to & including TO_TAG).  The algorithm is a
                               simple date-based one (this is a *hard* problem)
                               so results are imperfect
  -g OPTS, --global-opts OPTS  Invoke like this "cvs OPTS log ..."
  -l OPTS, --log-opts OPTS     Invoke like this "cvs ... log OPTS"
  FILE1 [FILE2 ...]            Show only log information for the named FILE(s)

=head1 NAME

cvs2cl.pl - produces GNU-style ChangeLogs in CVS working copies, by
    running "cvs log" and parsing the output.  Shared log entries are
    unified in an intuitive way.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script generates GNU-style ChangeLog files from CVS log
information.  Basic usage: just run it inside a working copy and a
ChangeLog will appear.  It requires repository access (i.e., 'cvs log'
must work).  Run "cvs2cl.pl --help" to see more advanced options.

See http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl for updates, and for instructions
on getting anonymous CVS access to this script.

Note about a bug-slash-opportunity:
-----------------------------------

There's a bug in Text::Wrap, which affects cvs2cl.  This script
reveals it:

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w

  use Text::Wrap;

  my $test_text =
  "This script demonstrates a bug in Text::Wrap.  The very long line
  following this paragraph will be relocated relative to the surrounding
  text:

  ====================================================================

  See?  When the bug happens, we'll get the line of equal signs below
  this paragraph, even though it should be above.";

  # Print out the test text with no wrapping:
  print "$test_text";
  print "\n";
  print "\n";

  # Now print it out wrapped, and see the bug:
  print wrap ("\t", "        ", "$test_text");
  print "\n";
  print "\n";

If the line of equal signs were one shorter, then the bug doesn't
happen.  Interesting.

Anyway, rather than fix this in Text::Wrap, we might as well write a
new wrap() which has the following much-needed features:

* initial indentation, like current Text::Wrap()
* subsequent line indentation, like current Text::Wrap()
* user chooses among: force-break long words, leave them alone, or die()?
* preserve existing indentation: chopped chunks from an indented line
  are indented by same (like this line, not counting the asterisk!)
* optional list of things to preserve on line starts, default ">"

Note that the last two are essentially the same concept, so unify in
implementation and give a good interface to controlling them.

And how about:

Optionally, when encounter a line pre-indented by same as previous
line, then strip the newline and refill, but indent by the same.
Yeah...
