How to profile gPlates
----------------------

	* configure script must have been run with --enable-prof,
		_before_ a complete recompilation
	* Run gplates in the src/ directory, and leave the generated
		"gmon.out" file there
	* Move into the scripts/ directory, and either run:
		./profile
	  or
		./graphical_profile

	  The former generates a raw dump (capture with a pager), and
	  the latter generates a "gplates-gprof.ps.gz" file.

NOTE: Expect the latter to fail a lot of the time - it currently uses some
	Perl filtering to handle C++ method signatures. It will improve over
	time, whenever Dave gets around to it.
