Conception
==========

GPlates was conceived in 2002 by the following committee:
 * Dietmar Müller [committee chair] (University of Sydney)
 * Stuart Clark (University of Sydney)
 * Mike Coffin (ORI/IFREE)
 * Mike Gurnis (Caltech)
 * Lawrence Lawver (PLATES/UTIG)
 * Louis Moresi (Monash University/VPAC)
 * Tim Redfield (PGP/NGU)
 * Walter Roest (GSC)

GPlates 0.5
===========

The first GPlates prototype ("GPlates 0.5") was created (2003) by:
 * James Boyden (University of Sydney)
 * Hamish Ivey-Law (University of Sydney)
with contributions by:
 * Mike Dowman (University of Sydney)
 * David Symonds (University of Sydney)
under the direction of:
 * Dietmar Müller
funded by grants from:
 * The Australian Research Council (ARC)

GPlates 0.5 was able to load geological data from PLATES4 line-format files
and total reconstruction poles (finite rotations) from PLATES4 rotation-format
files, perform plate-reconstructions to user-specified geological times, and
display animations over user-specified geological time intervals.  GPlates 0.5
had a simple, wxWidgets-based interactive graphical user-interface (GUI) and
displayed the 3-D globe in an orthographic projection in an OpenGL window. 
Geological data were coloured according to reconstruction plate ID.

GPlates 0.5 compiled and ran on Linux.

In particular, the following developers were primarily responsible for the
following significant aspects of GPlates functionality:
 * James Boyden
   + spherical geometries and quaternions
   + interpolation of finite rotations
   + plate-reconstructions
 * Hamish Ivey-Law
   + 3-D graphics using OpenGL
   + GPML v1 language and parser
   + interactive GUI
 * David Symonds
   + Autoconf-based build system


The GPlates 0.8.x series
========================

The GPlates 0.8.x series was a specialised branch of GPlates development
initiated and directed by Mike Gurnis at Caltech.  GPlates 0.8.x enhanced and
extended the GPlates 0.5 codebase with a significant amount of specialised
functionality, to enable GPlates to integrate with geodynamic modelling
software such as CitcomS and to become a component in a geodynamic modelling
workflow, in addition to broad additions to the general interactive
functionality.   Releases in the GPlates 0.8.x series were not released to the
public.

GPlates 0.8.x enabled the user to construct closed plate-boundaries
interactively and use plate-reconstructions to calculate plate-velocity fields
for input into CitcomS.

GPlates 0.8.x was created (2004-2007) by:
 * Mark Turner (Caltech)
with contributions by:
 * James Boyden
 * Hamish Ivey-Law
under the direction of:
 * Mike Gurnis
funded by grants through the Caltech Tectonics Observatory by:
 * The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation

In particular, the following developers were primarily responsible for the 
following significant aspects of GPlates functionality:
 * Mark Turner
   + extension of the PLATES4 file-format to represent geometric intersection
     topologies
   + extension of the PLATES4 data-model implementation in GPlates to represent
     geometric intersection topologies
   + development of the GPlates GUI for the topology-construction workflow
   + determination and implementation of the application logic of the manual
     topology-construction workflow
 * James Boyden
   + in-software mouse-pointer-interaction with graphical objects in the
     viewport
   + algorithmic intersection of spherical polyline geometries
   + calculation of point-velocities using finite rotations
 * Hamish Ivey-Law
   + research into automated topology-construction
   + the initial topology-construction prototype (2004)


GPGIM and GPML 1.5
==================

The GPGIM (GPlates Geological Information Model) is the formal description of
the geological and tectonic entities which GPlates simulates, the conceptual
building-blocks which GPlates defines, and the processing and simulation
constraints to which GPlates adheres.

The GPGIM is our abstract representation of our model of plate tectonics (as
far as our plans for GPlates functionality are concerned); as our information
model, it serves as our primary requirement for what needs to be implemented
in GPlates in order for GPlates to be able to represent our model of plate
tectonics.

The GPML (GPlates Markup Language) is an application schema of GML (Geography
Markup Language).  The GPML is intended to serve as the native file format of
GPlates.

The modelling for GPGIM 1.5 was performed (2005-2007) by:
 * James Clark (University of Sydney)
with assistance from:
 * Simon Cox (CSIRO Exploration & Mining)
with contributions by:
 * James Boyden
 * Mark Turner
with the geological expertise of:
 * Mike Gurnis
 * Christian Heine (postgrad student, EarthByte group, University of Sydney)
 * Dietmar Müller
 * Tim Redfield
 * Maria Sdrolias (postgrad student, EarthByte group, University of Sydney)
 * Trond Torsvik
 * Jo Whittaker (postgrad student, EarthByte group, University of Sydney)
under the direction of:
 * Dietmar Müller
funded by grants from:
 * The Australian Research Council (ARC)
 * The Australian Partnership for Advanced Computing (APAC)
 * The AuScope National Collaborative Research InfraStructure (NCRIS) Program

The XML schema for GPML 1.5 was created by:
 * James Clark
with assistance from:
 * Simon Cox


The GPlates 0.9.x series
======================

The GPlates 0.9.x series was a significant re-engineering of the GPlates 0.5
codebase, to implement the GPGIM inside GPlates (in the new "Model" component
of the GPlates software architecture), to restructure the architecture to allow
greater extensibility (for both geological/geophysical and general-purpose
functionality) and to migrate to a Qt-based GUI.

the following additional functionality: the ability to read ESRI Shapefiles;
the ability to save data in the PLATES4 line format; the ability to query the
GPGIM and GML properties of geological features in the Query Feature Properties
