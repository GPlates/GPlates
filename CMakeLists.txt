# Modern CMake requires version 3.
#
# Ubuntu Xenial (16.04 LTS) provides CMake 3.5.1, so we'll make this the minimum requirement.
# Also CMake 3.5 introduced imported targets for the Boost library.
#
# Note: There's a "..." between min and max versions which means we need to use the minimum version
#       but are safe to use with policies (see 'cmake_policy' command) up to the maximum version.
#       Specifying a maximum version means we don't need 'cmake_policy' calls for running CMake versions
#       in that [min, max] range. Note that CMake version prior to 3.12 apparently ignore the "...<max>" part.

# Set the minimum macOS version we support.
# We select 10.13 because Qt5 currently supports 10.13+.
# Also, as of 10.9, Apple has removed support for libstdc++ (the default prior to 10.9) in favour of libc++ (C++11).
# Note that this needs to be set before project() and must be a cache variable (avoids project() overwriting it).

# which we use to tell Sphinx (HTML document generator) where to find the 'pygplates' module
# (because Sphinx imports 'pygplates' to search its docstrings).
# Also we need to add a dependency to the 'pygplates' target so that it gets built first.
