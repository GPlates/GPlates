# This is an example categorical CPT file that can be used with GPlates.
#
# It assigns colours to plates 701 and 801, and all other plates are coloured
# grey.
#
# The format for categorical CPT files is described here:
# http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/latest/GMT_Docs.html#categorical-cpt-files
#
# In GPlates, categorical CPT files that assign colours to integer values
# (such as plate IDs) are interpreted as follows:
#  - First column (key): the value to be assigned a colour.
#  - Second column (fill): the colour to be assigned.
#  - Third column (label): (optional) description of the meaning of the value.
