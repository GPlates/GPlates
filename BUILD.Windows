Introduction

This will be a guide to building GPlates with various Windows development
environments. 

Using Microsoft Visual C++

The Visual C++ set of development tools is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio
suite. More information can be found at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ - the 
product page for Visual Studio.

Version requirements

GPlates can be built with version 14.0 (2015) of Microsoft Visual C++ (Visual Studio 2015).
GPlates also builds under older versions, however Visual Studio 2015 is required to
support the C++11 standard. Currently GPlates does not use C++11, however the
dependency library GDAL does require it for versions 2.3 and above (see DEPS.Windows).
As newer versions of Visual Studio are released, newer versions of the
dependencies will likely be required; if in doubt, for each dependency, download
the latest version instead of the version stated in DEPS.Windows.

Visual Studio Community

The Community edition of Visual Studio is freely available.
The steps for building GPlates with the Community edition are the
same as those for the other editions (such as Professional edition).

Note before starting

For any activities requiring the command line, remember to use the
"Developer Command Prompt for VS201X" shortcut available in the Windows "Start" menu.
This starts a command prompt and sets up environment variables, allowing use of VC command line 
applications (such as the compiler, linker, make and build tools).
Note that this is 32-bit. For a 64-bit version of GPlates you'll need a command prompt with a
64-bit Visual Studio toolset enabled. To do this:
* Start a standard command prompt, and run the following in it (keeping the double quotes intact):
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64

Program and library dependencies

Firstly, you should ensure that you have installed the dependencies as described in "DEPS.Windows".

Creating Visual Studio solution and project files with CMake

  1.  Install the library dependencies by following the instructions in "DEPS.Windows".
      Note that the 'CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH' and 'PATH' environment variables are used
      to help find some of these libraries (see "DEPS.Windows").
  2.  Run the CMake GUI program ('cmake-gui.exe').
  3.  Set the 'source' directory to the root GPlates source directory
      (the one that has 'src' as a sub-directory).
  4.  Set the 'build' directory to be the same as the 'source' directory for in-place builds or
      to a different directory for out-of-place builds (recommended for developers).
  5.  Click 'Configure'.
  6.  Specify 'Visual Studio 14 2015' for 32-bit or 'Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64' for 64-bit.
      Note that the library dependencies should be compiled as 32-bit or 64-bit respectively.
  7.  Once configuration finished you should get no popup messages saying a dependency could not be found.
      If you do then you might need to edit 'CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH' environment variable if it is not referring
      to the correct dependency locations.
  8.  Even if no popup messages occurred, the 'Generate' will still be greyed out so you'll need
      to click 'Configure' once more.
  9.  Click 'Generate'.
  10. The CMake GUI should then say 'Generating done' (or it might just close when finished).
  11. You should now have a 'GPlates.sln' file in your root GPlates directory.

Building GPlates via the IDE

  1. Open GPlates.sln with the Visual Studio IDE.
  2. Select 'Release' build from the "Build->Configuration Manager..." menu.
  3. Rebuild All from the Build menu.
     Or right-click on the 'gplates' project and select 'Rebuild' to only build the GPlates executable.

Building GPlates via the Command Line

  1. Run the Visual Studio 2015 Command Prompt.
     * This is "Developer Command Prompt for VS2015" for Visual Studio 2015.
       Note that this is 32-bit. To build a 64-bit version of GPlates you'll need a
       command prompt with a 64-bit Visual Studio toolset enabled. To do this:
       * Start a standard command prompt, and run the following in it (keeping the double quotes intact):
         "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
  2. Go to the root GPlates build directory. 
  3. Type the following on the command-line to build a release version of GPlates:
       msbuild gplates.sln /m /t:gplates /p:Configuration=Release /v:quiet
     ...where '/m' uses all CPUs, and '/t:gplates' just builds the GPlates executable
     (you can exclude it to build all targets).
